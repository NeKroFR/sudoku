# Sudoku

This repository is a collection of **generalized Sudoku** puzzles and solutions for square grids of size `N×N` where `N = K²` (2x2, 4×4, 8x8, 16×16, 32x32, 64x64, 100×100).

## Validity Rules

A solution is **valid** if:
1. Every row contains `1` to `N` exactly once.
2. Every column contains `1` to `N` exactly once.
3. Every `K×K` block contains `1` to `N` exactly once.
